## Go Restful Apis

### Installation

```go build main.go```
```go run main.go```

This repo uses Echo, Go minimalist framework.

Opening sqlLite db shows a new database table called books.

And hitting localhost:8080/books returns the list of the books from the sqlite DB.

Took inspiration from [here](https://www.codementor.io/@packt/how-to-set-up-a-project-in-echo-mpo39w5zu).
